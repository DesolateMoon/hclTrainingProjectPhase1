This program validates an email id by searching for a string entered by a user from an array of email ids (string). The program will 
verify that the email id is valid by comparing it to a REGEX expression. The valid characters allowed are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _, -, and 
periods. The program will then prompt the user for what email id to search for and will tell the user whether or not the email id
has been verified. The program keeps prompting the user until a valid email is inputted. Otherwise, the program will exit. 

By writing, this program I have displayed various skills I have learned. I utilized the Eclipse IDE which helped me write my program 
as well as used Git for version control. Furthermore, I was able to prove my comprehension of various Core Java concepts: Methods, 
collections, and strings.
