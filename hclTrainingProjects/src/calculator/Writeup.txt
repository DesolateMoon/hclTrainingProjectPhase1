This program is a calculator that performs the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The program will first prompt the user to input a number 1-4 which will represent which operation will occur. If the user inputs the
number 5, the program will end. Otherwise, the program will then prompt the user to input two numbers then the result will be computed 
with the operation chosen. This procedure will keep looping until the user exits the program by inputting the number 5.

By writing, this program I have displayed various skills I have learned. I utilized the Eclipse IDE which helped me write my program 
as well as used Git for version control. Furthermore, I was able to prove my comprehension of various Core Java concepts: Variables, 
data types, operators, type casting, control statements, class, objects, access specifiers, and core keywords like final, this, and static.
