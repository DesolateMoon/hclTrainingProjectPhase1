This program reads, writes, and appends an Employee objects in two different implementations. The first implementation 
utilizes FileI/OStream and ObjectI/OStream whereas the second implementation utilizes BufferedReader. The first implementation
will use the employee object declared at the top of the file. We begin by declaring a new FileOutputStream and ObjectOutputStream 
and pass in the desired output file name. For the input we do the reverse, by declaring a new FileInputStream and ObjectInputStream 
and pass in the desired input file name. Then for the second implementation the employee object's information will be passed in 
through the command line or otherwise known as args[]. The second implementation uses BufferedReader which will grab the necessary
information to create the employee object.

By writing, this program I have displayed various skills I have learned. I utilized the Eclipse IDE which helped me write my program 
as well as used Git for version control. Furthermore, I was able to prove my comprehension of various Core Java concepts: I/O, and
exception handling concepts such as throws.
